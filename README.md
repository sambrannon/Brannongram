# README

Brannongram is an Instagram-like application made to help me learn Rails.
It's made by following [these guides](https://www.devwalks.com/lets-build-instagram-in-rails-part-1/).

## Installation

The installation instructions are super verbose in hopes that I'll remember it better if I write it all down. It's all based on using [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) to manage Ruby versions.

1. Install Rails
  ```
  $ sudo gem install Rails
  ```
2. Install rbenv and bundler
  ```
  $ rbenv install
  $ gem install bundler
  $ rbenv rehash
  ```
3. Install the correct version of rbenv by
  ```
  $ cd /path/to/project
  $ rbenv install
  ```
